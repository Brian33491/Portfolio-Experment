            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The original goal of the project was to improve the advising page for the SOE, aiming to increase student engagement and make sure students knew that advisors were always available to help. However, after conducting some research, we realized that the problem wasn't limited to just the advising page—it was the entire website. As a result, our project expanded from improving a single page to revamping the whole website.</p>

        <div class="detail-section">
            <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
            <p>We began by observing our target audience—students—and analyzing their behavior and device usage. I visited the library, the LA building, and the food court, where I found that the majority of students were using laptops or school PCs, with a smaller group using their phones and just one person on a tablet. Additionally, I observed that about 70% of students were female, while 30% were male.</p>

            <h2>User Interviews</h2>
            <p>Following the surveys, I interviewed Carlos, an SOE student aiming to graduate in Pre-Elementary Education. From our conversation, I learned that Carlos would visit the advising website if it contained useful information. However, he mentioned that he wouldn't visit the page for scheduling since he already used MyUVU for that purpose. He also wished the site would show when classes are available, such as whether they are offered in the fall, spring, or summer semesters.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>After presenting our findings to our clients, explaining how students struggled to find the advising page, we began the design phase. We conducted eye-tracking tests which showed that most students had difficulty navigating the website or felt overwhelmed by the information presented.</p>

            <p>After completing our research, I created wireframes with the goal of improving the Faculty And Staff, Livescan Fingerprinting, and Global Opportunities page. For the Faculty And Staff page, I added an additional navigation bar so students wouldn't have to scroll endlessly to find their advisors. For Livescan, I organized the information into cards for better clarity, and I did the same for the Global Opportunities page.</p>

            <p>We presented our work to the advisors and other SOE staff, who were impressed with our findings and the improvements we made. They appreciated how we addressed the issues with the website—such as students feeling overwhelmed by information—and the challenge of students giving up when trying to find their first-year advisors. They particularly liked the updates, like having the first-year advisor listed on the SOE advising page, the addition of an FAQ section, and the creation of a new page called student resources.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project taught me how much easier and faster a project can be when working with a team. I also learned just how much time is spent on research, which I found to be incredibly beneficial. What started as a small task grew into a much larger project, and I found that process really interesting. Overall, this was one of my favorite projects to work on, and it was fun collaborating with others for the first time.</p>
