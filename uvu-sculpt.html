                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The objective was to design posters and digital signage that would raise awareness of the SCULPT Showcase among UVU students and drive event attendance. The goal was to create eye-catching, clear designs that would excite students and encourage participation.</p>
                
                <p>The campaign needed to stand out in a busy campus environment while maintaining UVU brand guidelines and effectively communicating event details through accessible sign-up methods.</p>

                <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
                <p>I began by researching the SCULPT UVU Showcase, an annual event hosted by Utah Valley University that highlights student work across creative disciplines including sculpture, visual arts, graphic design, and other forms of creative expression.</p>
                
                <p>The target audience encompassed all UVU students—from DGM students wanting to showcase projects, to dance department members preparing recitals, to anyone with creative work, research, or passions they want to share. This could include art, performances, academic research, or any project students are proud of.</p>
                
                <p>Understanding this diverse audience was crucial for creating inclusive designs that would appeal to students across all departments and disciplines, not just traditional art students.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>I created initial sketches for posters and digital signage, implementing them in Canva while adhering to UVU brand guidelines. The focus was on clear, engaging visuals with easily readable text, experimenting with various styles and layouts.</p>
                
                <p>The design strategy centered on creating high-impact visuals that could capture attention in high-traffic campus areas while maintaining readability and clear calls-to-action. Each design needed to work across multiple formats and display sizes.</p>

                <h2>Design Iteration</h2>
                <p>Based on feedback from Dan and event organizers, I refined the designs to improve clarity and readability while ensuring alignment with the event's identity and UVU's visual standards.</p>
                
                <p>The iteration process involved testing different color schemes, typography hierarchies, and layout configurations. We experimented with QR code placement to maximize scan rates while maintaining visual balance and brand consistency.</p>
                
                <p>Key considerations included ensuring the designs would be effective both as large-format digital displays and as printed posters, maintaining legibility across different viewing distances and lighting conditions.</p>

                <p>The digital signage and posters were launched across campus in strategic high-traffic locations. Due to time constraints, we measured success primarily through QR code sign-ups and attendance rates rather than extended testing periods.</p>
                
                <p>Materials were placed in the library, student center, academic buildings, and other key gathering spaces to maximize visibility and reach. The QR code provided an easy, frictionless way for interested students to sign up immediately.</p>

                <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
                <p>The campaign successfully achieved its primary objectives, with measurable engagement through QR code sign-ups and strong event attendance. Over 100 students signed up directly through the QR code on the promotional materials, providing concrete evidence of the campaign's reach.</p>
                
                <p>The showcase was well-attended with strong participation across multiple disciplines. While we couldn't track every attendee's discovery method, we confirmed that at least 100 students engaged with the promotional materials through the QR code.</p>
                
                <p>The strategic placement of materials in high-traffic areas combined with clear messaging and accessible sign-up methods contributed to the campaign's success in raising awareness and driving participation.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The campaign successfully drove awareness and participation for the SCULPT Showcase. The combination of strategic placement, clear messaging, and accessible sign-up methods resulted in measurable engagement and strong event turnout.</p>
                
                <p>This project demonstrated the importance of understanding your audience and creating designs that work across multiple formats and contexts. The success of the QR code integration showed that combining traditional design with modern technology can create effective pathways for engagement.</p>
                
                <p>The project provided a foundation for future promotional efforts, establishing design patterns and strategies that can be refined and expanded for subsequent events. The positive response from both organizers and students validated our approach to campus event promotion.</p>
                
                <p>Working within UVU brand guidelines while creating distinctive, attention-grabbing designs proved that constraints can drive creativity rather than limit it. The project reinforced the value of iterative design and stakeholder collaboration in achieving successful outcomes.</p>
